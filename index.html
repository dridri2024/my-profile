        <p>
          As I said before (several times already), my name is Adriana. I'm originally from Ecuador, but have lived in some places like NYC and Paris. I love music, arts, media, content creation and honestly, everything that involves an audience and connecting with people.

        <h2>Music</h2>
        <p> Since I was a kid, music has been an essential part of my life, appearing in maany parts of my life. Through the years, this love for music develop into my passion and what I want to do in the future.
          Stay tuned for future projects related to this passion of mine!<p>

      <div class="card-white">
        <h2> Arts</h3>
        <p> This is another passion of mine. When I talk about arts, I talk about most of the expressions in which we can find "art". From paitings to dance to poetry; art is truly the driving force of my core persona.</p>
